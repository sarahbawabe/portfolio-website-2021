    <h2>overview</h2>
    <p>The UX Factor is an <strong>online grading platform</strong> that allows users to anonymously
      view others' submissions and give their feedback. The goal of this is to allow
      students to get as much feedback as possible, while still maintaining the
      anonymity of each submission. In order to quantitatively analyze each students'
      submission (which allows us to translate feedback into a grade), we ask pointed
      questions and ask users to determine which submission, given a pair of two
      submissions, better answers the task of the question. In this way, we can not
      only give helpful feedback to students based on their peers' responses, but
      also a quantitative grade that is, ideally, <strong>less biased than a grade that would
      be given solely by one reviewer</strong>.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>planning + sketching</h2>
    <p>Beginning with just a basic concept, I began the process of building this
    grading platform by reading papers, doing research on pre-existing peer review
    softwares, and gathering opinions and advice from peers. Following this, I
    created a variety of sketches to help me visualize and brainstorm what the
    multitude of information I had gathered could look like in this grading platform.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>building the platform</h2>
    <p>After experimenting with a variety of setups, we decided to create a login
    page and a comparison page. Deciding that it would be simpler for users to
    have one page per submission pair, this setup would help simplify and clarify
    the different evaluation tasks that we were asking users to complete.</p>

    <h2>user testing</h2>
    <div class="flex-row" id="user-testing">
      <img class="half-width-img" src="uiux/usertesting.jpg"
        style="border: 2px solid #E8E8E8; border-radius: 5px; margin: 0px 10px;">

      <div class="flex-column">
        <p>It was decided to conduct two rounds of user testing over the summer, due
        to time constraints on having this platform ready for the fall semester. A
        sample of the first user testing document is shown here, where <strong>we asked users
        to perform specific tasks, and fill out a google feedback form with their
        notes, comments, and critiques.</strong> </p>
        <p>Following user testing, we ended up making a variety of changes, including
          but not limited to:</p>
        <li>altering our layout to the side-by-side view seen above (rather than
          a column view, which did not utilize whitespace as well)</li>
        <li>swapping wording to clarify button functionality</li>
        <li>adding preview images to help users remember which submission was which
        after visiting the associated submission links</li>
        <li>blurring these images slightly so that users would not be able to rely
        solely on the preview image to answer questions</li>
        <li>adding a tutorial button that would reopen the tutorial popup</li>
        <li>adding a "are you sure?" popup when clicking the submit button</li>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>current prototype + coming soon</h2>
    <p>Information about the latest version of the prototype and how you can install it
      can be found by following
      the link below. We are currently working on adding functionality to weigh TA
      feedback more, allow students to see which submissions scored better than theirs
      in certain categories, and fully automating our current grading script (which
      translates the information gathered from the UX Factor into grades).</p>
